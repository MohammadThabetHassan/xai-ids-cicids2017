## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Research Quality) ← depends on 1.1, 1.2
    ↓
Phase 3 (Multi-Dataset) ← depends on 2.1, 2.2
    ↓
Phase 4 (Engineering) ← can run in parallel after Phase 2
    ↓
Phase 5 (Portfolio) ← final polish after all above
```

## Notes

- This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as priorities shift
- Effort estimates assume single developer working 2-4 hours/day
- Multi-dataset evaluation completed via Kaggle notebook (Tesla T4 GPU)
- XCS (XAI Confidence Score) implemented: XCS = 0.4×Confidence + 0.3×(1-SHAP_Instability) + 0.3×Jaccard(SHAP,LIME)
