## Intended Use

### Primary Uses
- **Research**: Studying explainability methods (SHAP, LIME) for intrusion detection
- **Education**: Teaching ML pipeline construction, model evaluation, and XAI techniques
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing model performance across multiple IDS datasets
- **XAI Methodology**: Demonstrating the novel XAI Confidence Score (XCS) for explanation reliability

### Out-of-Scope Uses

- **Real-time network monitoring**: The pipeline is designed for batch analysis, not real-time inference
- **Standalone security decision-making**: Should be used as part of a defense-in-depth strategy
- **Datasets not evaluated on**: Models trained on CIC-IDS-2017 may not generalize to other datasets (cross-dataset Jaccard = 0.324)

## XAI Confidence Score (XCS)

The XCS measures explanation reliability:

```
XCS = 0.4 × Confidence + 0.3 × (1 - SHAP_Instability) + 0.3 × Jaccard(SHAP, LIME)
```

- **Threshold**: XCS > 0.3 for acceptable explanation reliability
- **Cross-dataset Jaccard similarity**: 0.324

### XCS Results (v2 — full LIME formula, synthetic test sets, n=100)

| Dataset | Mean XCS | Mean Confidence | Mean SHAP Instability | Mean Jaccard | Flagged (< 0.3) |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| CIC-IDS-2017 | 0.420 | 0.478 | 0.416 | 0.178 | 0 / 100 (0%) |
| UNSW-NB15 | 0.386 | 0.310 | 0.253 | 0.126 | 5 / 100 (5%) |
| CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 | 0.675 | 0.999 | 0.226 | 0.143 | 0 / 100 (0%) |

Previous v2.0.1 CSVs had jaccard_sl=0 for all samples because LIME never ran
during XCS computation. Recomputed with `scripts/recompute_xcs.py`; see
`explanations/xcs_*_v2.csv` for per-sample data.

## Limitations and Biases

1. **Class Imbalance**: Severe imbalance in CIC-IDS-2017 (~600:1 ratio) causes poor detection of minority attack classes even with balanced class weights.

2. **Dataset Specificity**: Cross-dataset feature importance shows low Jaccard similarity (0.324), meaning models trained on one dataset do not generalize well to others.

3. **Feature Selection**: The Kaggle notebook uses 20 features per dataset (selected by importance), while the main pipeline uses all 78 CIC-IDS-2017 features. Results are not directly comparable.

4. **Synthetic Data Default**: The main pipeline defaults to synthetic data. Real data requires download or running the Kaggle notebook.

5. **Temporal Drift**: Network attack patterns evolve over time. Models trained on 2017/2018 data may not detect modern attack variants.

6. **False Positives**: Even with 99.6% accuracy, the extreme class imbalance means false positives can overwhelm alerts in production.

7. **UNSW-NB15 Performance**: 80% accuracy on UNSW-NB15 indicates significant room for improvement, especially on minority attack classes (Analysis, Backdoor, Shellcode, Worms).

8. **CICIDS2018 class diversity**: The current Kaggle notebook run
   captured only 2 of the 14+ available attack classes due to the
   chunked CSV sampler stopping before reaching files with rarer
   attacks. The `load_csv_files_stratified()` function in the updated
   notebook fixes this by sampling proportionally per label value
   within each file.

## Ethical Considerations

- This model is for research and educational purposes only
- Does not constitute a production security solution
- False positives may impact legitimate network traffic analysis
- Should be used as part of a defense-in-depth strategy with human oversight
- Model decisions should not be used for legal or disciplinary actions without human review

## Reproducibility

- Random seed (42) used consistently throughout the pipeline
- Deterministic train/test splitting with stratification
- All preprocessing artifacts (scaler, encoder) saved for inference
- Full pipeline executable via single command: `python run_pipeline.py`
- Multi-dataset results reproducible via Kaggle notebook with GPU
